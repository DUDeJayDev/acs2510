# Hi :)

This is a weird dataset. It's sourced from [UC Irine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/853/non+verbal+tourists+data). The idea is... nice but it's pulled off just so poorly, but by the time I realized this I was in too deep. You'll find actual insight inside [the notebook file](./final.ipynb)
